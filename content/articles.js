    "<p>I wear a few silicon bracelets, not necessarilly to stand for anything, also not necessarilly not to, but as constant reminders to myself that I'm not ok. I have to make considerations for myself, for multiple reasons. </p>"+
    "<p>The orange bracelet represents MS. I might not be as fast or as physically capable as I once was. And unfortunately this requires a daily reminder to not be as hard on myself. I hold myself to an astronomical standard and just stairs humble me constantly.</p>"+
    "<p>I also wear a black with a green stripe. This represents my BiPolar condition. Too many times I get caught up in something only to look down and think, \"Is this a delusion? Is this just a flight of ideas?\" Before re-assuring myself that most likely it is. No one is coming for me, I am not in danger.</p>"+
    "<p>The third bracelt is a sandy colored one with the suicide hotline number on it. I picked it up while talking with who I call my 'VA buddy'. It reminds me that most of my fears stem from being a deployed soldier. Even though I didn't 'see some shit' I was still scared unlike anywhere else and it still resonates. There are days where I feel that same fear. I still feel like my life is not within my own control. That I'm merely degrees away from death. This one tries to remind me that I may have been in sketchy situations at some time but not anymore.</p>"+
    "<p>The last one I have is a pure black from the wounded warrior project. It reminds me to take a step back from time to time and accecpt the help offered to me. I may have been a fighter, a warrior, but that is no longer the case. I am recovering and that is the only fight left for me.</p>"+
    "<p>These work as great grounding techniques and they really do help me from time to time. When I feel like I'm spiraling out of control, I look down and take inventory of what my actual challenges are.</p>"+

  	title: "My Experience With Discovering I have Multiple Scerlosis",
    keyword: ["ms"],
  	content: "This is a weird one. I can go back and refer to times since I was only 10-12 years old but hindsight is 20/20. I can really only attribute my adult aged symptoms to MS. Anything further would be potentially disengenious.</p>"+
    "<p>I've had migranes for about the past 10-15 years give or take, I only recently (2016) found myself with the necessarry health coverage to determine the cause of them. I first met with my PCP in late 2017 and then a neurologist to hopefully get the migranes under control with medications. I was given some meds, which really didn't do anything to make it better, but while I was under this neuros care. I started exibiting more symptoms that I have never experienced. Vertigo, double vision, and Lhermitteâ€™s sign.</p>"+
    "<p>These symptoms were completely alien to me but my neuro was able to recognize that it was a fairly damning collection of problems. He had me admitted to the ER and ran a battery of tests. Blood for days, MRIs, and observation while getting a solumedrol IV. Luckily the solumedrol treatement made the symptoms abate. But by the end of the treatment I was left with a chronic diagnosis. Multiple Scerlosis.</p>"+
    "<p>I had no idea what to expect but I knew people previously that had MS and they seemed to lead an active and productive life with MS. I thought I was in the clear. I had no idea what weight the diagnosis would lay on my life.</p>"+
    "<p>I'm on some good meds nowadays (Ocrevus) but MS still clouds every twinge, any pain I feel could be a symptom and only reminds me of the diagnosis. I still have a hard time dealing with MS hanging over my head two years later. I still wish for the days of consistency, where I can wake up and know how my body can preform. I hope for days where I can carry my diagnosis with as much poise and grace as the friend I know has had it for much longer than I.</p>"+

  	title: "My Experience With Discovering I'm Bipolar",
    keyword: ["bp"],
  	content: "I was diagnosed with bipolar in January of 2017, this was after a burnout of life-changing proportions. After reading and reflecting on my own life, I've been 'bipolar' for years. I got through college riding a wave of hypo-mania which carried me through my first year of having a 'big-boy-job' but culminated in a month straight of full on mania.</p>"+
    "<p>College was a whirlwind of little/poly-phasic sleep while I programmed my balls off chasing the delusion of grandeur of 'going west'. I created things as I learned each new tool to build out a portfolio. Outside looking in I was a try-hard, a go-getter, a passionate developer. Looking back from the inside out, I was sick. I would sacrifice sleep and familial/social activities to chase an idea, a grand plan. I would wake up from a dead sleep to further iterate on a project or to fix a bug that was left hanging. I would plan out an idea from conception to full market saturation and believe I had a 3.26 billion dollar idea (yes, that number is delusionally researched). I was not stable. All of that effort, all of those plans were for one simple goal, <b>get a job out west</b>.</p>" +
    "<p>Once I got there my hypo-mania kinda subsided for a little bit but as soon as I got comfortable there the real mania kicked in hard. After about a year of holding down a job to accecptable standards, I went manic. It wasn't the same hypo-mania that got me through college. It was an all consuming urge to pull this idea out of my dumb head, it wasn't sustainable. I didn't care about work, I didn't care about eating, sleeping, or friends and family. All that mattered was working on the <a href='https://github.com/Thilly/mania2017'>'project.'</a> It was a never ending deluge of weird hypothetical-pseudo-scientific-mathematical jargon that made so much sense at the time that I was litterally (yes I mean litterally) willing to die to get the idea onto paper.</p>"+
    "<p>During this time, I slept for maybe 2-3 hours in a 48 hour block. I rarely ate, and I was supplementing my nutrition with a saltwater and sand (yes, thats right) concoction. I was as batshit as they come. For the length of this manic episode, I worked tirelessly. I tried to get the idea out through metaphor, physical art, abstract math, and finally code. Along the way, I ran away from my apartment at 2am only to be picked up off the peak of San Bruno mountain by EMTs, kidnapped my wife to try and abscond to another dimension. After the kidnapping I was hospitalized for almost 2 weeks while they stabilized me. I was on a handful of meds which I immediately went non-compliant. I didn't want help. I wanted to get the idea out. It was so beautiful, so simple, so elegant.</p>"+
    "<p>After my hospitilization, I managed to create something that made enough sense to me that it seemed to crystalize all of the effort. What I called a <a href='https://github.com/Thilly/mania2017/blob/master/Programs/modules/qubit.js'>qubit</a>. It made so much sense it ended my manic episode as quickly as it started. Since then, I havent or better put, I won't get involved with programming as deeply. I've been hiding. I hope to avoid another manic episode since the last one was caused by chasing an idea. I'm arguably stable now, and I'd like to keep it that way.</p>"+

  	title: "Ongoing Deliberation",
    keyword: ["dev"],
  	content: "Now that its up and running, I'm conflicted about what direction to go with it. On v5 I engineered build, management, deploy and testing tools. I still plan on doing the same, but I want to actually add some legit content this time, not just journaling the development of the thing the journal is on. (yo dawg, I heard you like recursion)</p>" +
  	"<p>I figure I'll have three tabs of content. One to discuss ongoing development and experimentation like I did on v5, and another for things related to my journey with MS. Because as shitty as MS is. It's interesting, I can't argue with that. Also, having a place to dump symptoms, tribulations, and solutions could be pretty cathartic I think. And maybe, just maybe, I might put something down that helps someone else through a rough point.</p>" +
	"<p>For the last tab, I'm still torn. I was thinking a space where I would pick apart the ramblings and crazy-talk from my manic episode since that was pretty wild. But I feel I might dig myself into a metaphorical pit where any readers (if there are any) would legit think I'm fucking nuts. I'm not, but I was. Its a distinction I think needs to be said. It would be disengenious to pretend I didn't shatter my reality into a million pieces that I'm still re-assembling." +
	"<p>So anyway, thats where I'm at, mentally stalled on development untill I decide on 'tabs'.</p>" +

    content: "I have my server back, but because of <i>'reasons'</i>, I lost version 5. So thats 6 months of work dissolved into the ether of a reformat. Its still on github for posterity but all the content (including cms) was on mongo, so *gone*. Version 6 never went anywhere, and 7 was some half assed attempt at using google app engine where I got lost in the setup and barely squeezed out a hello world on it. So far I'm just getting my bearings on angular and ejs, seems like they're popular so no reason not to use em. So now I'm playing with tutes and seeing where this goes. Hopefully angular is floppy enough to let me play how what I want.</p>" +
    "<p>My stack so far is express serving ejs with some angular on the front. Pretty tiny stack and no real content to speak of, but it'll grow quick.</p>" +
    "<p>I plan on building it around my todo list. Its pretty central to my own development and its neat to see progress unfold. As is previously demonstrated, I'm not a designer, so expect it to look like butt :P</p>" +
