Its still on github for posterity but all the content (including cms) was on mongo, so *gone*. Version 6 never went anywhere, and 7 was some half assed attempt at using google app engine where I got lost in the setup and barely squeezed out a hello world on it. So far I'm just getting my bearings on angular and ejs, seems like they're popular so no reason not to use em. So now I'm playing with tutes and seeing where this goes. Hopefully angular is floppy enough to let me play how what I want.</p>" +
    "<p>My stack so far is express serving ejs with some angular on the front. Pretty tiny stack and no real content to speak of, but it'll grow quick.</p>" +
    "<p>I plan on building it around my todo list. Its pretty central to my own development and its neat to see progress unfold. As is previously demonstrated, I'm not a designer, so expect it to look like butt :P</p>" +
