  	content: "Now that its up and running, I'm conflicted about what direction to go with it. On v5 I engineered build, management, deploy and testing tools. I still plan on doing the same, but I want to actually add some legit content this time, not just journaling the development of the thing the journal is on. (yo dawg, I heard you like recursion)</p>" +
  	"<p>I figure I'll have three tabs of content. One to discuss ongoing development and experimentation like I did on v5, and another for things related to my journey with MS. Because as shitty as MS is. It's interesting, I can't argue with that. Also, having a place to dump symptoms, tribulations, and solutions could be pretty cathartic I think. And maybe, just maybe, I might put something down that helps someone else through a rough point.</p>" +
	"<p>For the last tab, I'm still torn. I was thinking a space where I would pick apart the ramblings and crazy-talk from my manic episode since that was pretty wild. But I feel I might dig myself into a metaphorical pit where any readers (if there are any) would legit think I'm fucking nuts. I'm not, but I was. Its a distinction I think needs to be said. It would be disengenious to pretend I didn't shatter my reality into a million pieces that I'm still re-assembling." +
	"<p>So anyway, thats where I'm at, mentally stalled on development untill I decide on 'tabs'.</p>" +

    content: "I have my server back, but because of <i>'reasons'</i>, I lost version 5. So thats 6 months of work dissolved into the ether of a reformat. Its still on github for posterity but all the content (including cms) was on mongo, so *gone*. Version 6 never went anywhere, and 7 was some half assed attempt at using google app engine where I got lost in the setup and barely squeezed out a hello world on it. So far I'm just getting my bearings on angular and ejs, seems like they're popular so no reason not to use em. So now I'm playing with tutes and seeing where this goes. Hopefully angular is floppy enough to let me play how what I want.</p>" +
    "<p>My stack so far is express serving ejs with some angular on the front. Pretty tiny stack and no real content to speak of, but it'll grow quick.</p>" +
    "<p>I plan on building it around my todo list. Its pretty central to my own development and its neat to see progress unfold. As is previously demonstrated, I'm not a designer, so expect it to look like butt :P</p>" +
