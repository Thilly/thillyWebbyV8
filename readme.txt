Going through some 'tutes' and playing around with AngularJS and node/express.
This time I'm not going to homebrew EVERYTHING and actually learn what/how the
industries use and play along.

I'll prolly build it around the 'todo list', since thats usually pretty central to my development story anyway, and its like the second tute for angular.
